/* Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app. */


/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE study_pal (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    subject TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER);

INSERT INTO study_pal (subject, minutes) VALUES ("Calculus", 50);
INSERT INTO study_pal (subject, minutes) VALUES ("World History", 15);
INSERT INTO study_pal (subject, minutes) VALUES ("Physics", 30);
INSERT INTO study_pal (subject, minutes) VALUES ("English Literature", 60);

SELECT * FROM study_pal;

UPDATE study_pal set subject = "Biology"
WHERE id = 3;

SELECT * FROM study_pal;

DELETE FROM study_pal 
WHERE id = 4;

SELECT * FROM study_pal;
